# Fibonacci

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55...

The sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation:  
`Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2`

Starting with: F0 = 1, F1 = 1

So we will give you n of the sequence, and you have to return Fn.
