# Calculator

The challenge's aim is to code some basic calculator's operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide and modulo.

You have to implement these operations given in the file **Calculator.java** and write some tests for each operation 
in the file **CalculatorTest.java**.
Every possibility must be tested for each operation: for 2 given integers X and Y,
you have to test: 
- (X) operation (Y)
- (-X) operation (Y)
- (X) operation (-Y)
- (-X) operation (Y)
- (-X) operation (-Y)
- Don't forget the case where X=0 or/and Y=0 !
